# Discussion Questions

## Binary Search Trees

Please read through these before class, and come prepared to have a meaningful discussion with your peers

For each question we'll discuss in small groups, then as a big group

## General

1. Introduce yourself to your group!
1. What questions or comments do you have after watching the video lectures?
1. What would it look like to augment our BST or RBT with a custom comparison function, that is, relying on a user-defined order instead of a natural one? Does this change the time or space complexity of our operations?
1. How would you check _equivalence_ for two BSTs?
    - Analyze the time and space complexity
    - How would this change for an RBT?
    - Is it possible for two BSTs or RBTs with different internal structures to be equivalent?
1. How would you _serialize_ and _deserialize_ a BST?
    - What about an RBT?
    - What are the time and space complexities of these operations?

## Extra

These questions aren't very practical, but they are interesting! Borrowed from _Introduction to Algorithms_ by Cormen et al.
