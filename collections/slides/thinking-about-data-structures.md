# Thinking About Data Structures

## Learning Goals

---

## What is a Data Structure?

---

## Why are Data Structures important?

Data structures are the bones of our program

Choosing a DS that matches the problem will make it easy to write clean, efficient code

---

## What do we get from studying Data Structures

Knowledge of specific data structures

Opportunity to practice...

- Tricky implementations
- Analysis
- Design (OO and otherwise)

Data Structures problems tend to be **well-defined** and **isolated**, which makes them great practice (and interview) problems

## How should we study Data Structures?

## Interface

@snap[west text-left span-47]

What does it look like from the outside

- Methods, arguments, return values
- Conditions and assumptions
- Guarantees

@snapend

@snap[east text-left span-47]

```js zoom-12
const stack = new Stack();

stack.push(1);
stack.push(2);
stack.push(3);

const first = stack.pop();
```

## Implementation

What does it look like on the inside?

- Structure

- Algorithms

---

## Structure

How is the data organized?

- Classes, members, relations

- Does this DS rely on another?

- Draw a picture!

---

## Algorithms

How do the methods work?

- Edge cases

- Testing

- Time and space complexity
